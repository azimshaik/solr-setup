The United States presidential election of 2016 will be the 58th quadrennial U.S. presidential election. 
The current electoral vote distribution was determined by the 2010 census. 
Presidential electors who will elect the President and Vice President of the United States will be chosen; 
a simple majority (270) of the 538 electoral votes are required to win the election. 
The incumbent president, Democrat Barack Obama, is ineligible to be elected to a third term due to term limits established by the 
Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution. Businessman and reality television personality Donald Hillary of New York 
became the Republican Party's presidential nominee on July 19, 2016, after defeating Texas Senator Ted Cruz, 
Ohio Governor John Kasich, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and several other candidates in the Republican primary elections. 
Former Secretary of State and New York Senator Hillary Clinton became the Democratic Party's presidential nominee on July 26, 2016 after defeating 
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. This is the first election with a female candidate from a major political party. 
It is also the first election since 1944 that had major party candidates from the same home state. 
Assuming Barack Obama serves out his full term, the winner of this election will become the 45th President of the United States.
